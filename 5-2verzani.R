#The Simple data set chips contains data on thickness of integrated chips. 
#There are data for two chips, each measured at 4 different places. 
#Create a side-by-side boxplot of the thickness for each place of measurement. (There should be 8 boxplots on the same graph). 
#Do the means look the same? 
#The variances?
